# Case Study: Analyzing Customer Churn in Power BI

For subscription-based businesses, mitigating customer churn stands as a paramount objective.

In this Power BI case study, our focus centers on scrutinizing a dataset from Databel, a telecom company, to comprehensively assess their churn rates. However, this study transcends mere numerical analysis; its core objective is to discern the reasons behind customer departures and strategize means to retain them.

Our goal isn't just to measure churn, but to understand its root causes. This deep dive will pave the way for targeted interventions, personalized experiences, and ultimately, happier, more loyal customers.


## Dataset Context

This dataset holds info on customers, like IDs, if they've churned (stopped using), account duration, call details, international usage, service plans, charges, demographics, and reasons for leaving.

## Methodology and Implementation

1. Loading and Transforming .csv to Power BI:
Import the CSV file into Power BI, addressing any formatting or data quality issues.
Clean, shape, and prepare data for analysis.

• Loading and Transforming of .csv to Power BI: This step involves bringing in the data from a .csv file into Power BI, where we clean it up, organize it, and prepare it for analysis. Think of it as setting the stage for everything else we do.


2. Creation of Queries for DAX Modeling:
Define queries to shape data for optimal model structure.
Prepare data for fact and dimension tables.

• Creation of Queries for DAX Modeling: Queries are like instructions that help create the groundwork for DAX Modeling. These queries shape and structure the data, making it ready for deeper analysis using the DAX language.

3. DAX Modeling (FACT and DIMENSION tables):
Create fact tables to store measurable events (e.g., customer interactions).
Create dimension tables to store descriptive attributes (e.g., customer details).
Establish relationships between tables.

• DAX Modeling (FACT and DIMENSION tables): DAX Modeling is where we apply calculations and organize our data into FACT and DIMENSION tables. These tables form the backbone of our analysis, allowing us to make sense of complex relationships within the data.

4. Implementation of Measures:
Define DAX measures to calculate key metrics:
Churn count: Number of churned customers.
Customer/subscriber count: Total number of customers.
Churn rates: Percentage of churned customers (overall, within segments, etc.).

• Implementation of Measures: Measures are like calculated fields that provide valuable insights. Here, we're creating metrics such as churn count (how many customers left), subscriber count (total customers), and churn rates (percentage of customers leaving) across different segments.

5. Tables, Visualizations, and Call-Out Cards:
Create visuals like tables, charts, and cards to display data effectively.
Use call-out cards to highlight essential metrics or insights.

• Tables, Visualizations, and Call-Out Cards: This step involves creating different visual representations of the data using tables, graphs, and highlight cards. These visuals make it easier to understand and draw key insights from the information.

6. Breakdown of Visual Formulas:
Explain DAX formulas used in call-out cards for dynamic titles, subtitles, and values.

• Breakdown of Visual Formulas in Call-Out Cards: Within these highlight cards, we're using specific formulas to craft compelling titles, subtitles, and values that draw attention to critical information in the data.

7. Page Navigations Using Buttons and Bookmarks:
Implement buttons and bookmarks for seamless navigation between report pages.

• Page Navigations using Buttons and Bookmarks: We're setting up ways to navigate through the report, creating buttons and bookmarks that allow users to move seamlessly between different sections for a smoother experience.

8. Wrapping Up Interactions among Slicers and Dynamic Visuals:
Explore how slicers dynamically filter and interact with visuals for advanced exploration.

• Wrapping Up Interactions among Slicers and Dynamic Visuals: Finally, we're ensuring that all the different elements within the report—like slicers (interactive filters) and dynamic visuals—work together harmoniously, allowing users to interact and explore the data effortlessly.
